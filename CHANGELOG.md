This is a very large release! The long term of `Konva` API is to make it simpler and faster. So when possible I am trying to optimize the code and remove unpopular/confusing API methods.

**BREAKING:**

- `Konva.Collection` is removed. `container.children` is a simple array now. `container.find()` will returns an array instead of `Konva.Collection()` instance.
  `Konva.Collection` was confusing for many users. Also it was slow and worked with a bit of magic. So I decided to get rif of it. Now we are going to use good old arrays.

```js
// old code:
group.find('Shape').visible(false);

// new code:
group.find('Shape').forEach((shape) => shape.visible(false));
```

- argument `selector` is removed from `node.getIntersection(pos)` API. I don't think you even knew about it.
- `Konva.Util.extend` is removed.
- All "content" events from `Konva.Stage` are removed. E.g. instead of `contentMousemove` just use `mousemove` event.

**New features:**

- All updates on canvas will do automatic redraw with `layer.batchDraw()`. This features is configurable with `Konva.autoDrawEnabled` property. Konva will automatically redraw layer when you change any property, remove or add nodes, do caching. So you don't need to call `layer.draw()` or `layer.batchDraw()` in most of the cases.
- New method `layer.getNativeCanvasElement()`
- new `flipEnabled` property for `Konva.Transformer`
- new `node.isClientRectOnScreen()` method
- Added `Konva.Util.degToRad` and `Konva.Util.radToDeg`
- Added `node.getRelativePointerPosition()`

**Changes and fixes:**

- **Full migration to ES modules package (!), commonjs code is removed.**
- **`konva-node` is merged into `konva` npm package. One package works for both environments.**
- Full event system rewrite. Much better `pointer` events support.
- Fix `TextPath` recalculations on `fontSize` change
- Better typescript support. Now every module has its own `*.d.ts` file.
- Removed `Konva.UA`, `Konva._parseUA` (it was used for old browser detection)
- Fixed Arrow head position when an arrow has tension
- `textPath.getKerning()` is removed
- Fix `a` command parsing for `Konva.Path`
- Fix fill pattern for `Konva.Text` when the pattern has an offset or rotation
- `Konva.names` and `Konva.ids` are removed
- `Konva.captureTouchEventsEnabled` is renamed to `Konva.capturePointerEventsEnabled`

## 7.2.5

Probably 99% `Konva` applications will be not affected by this _breaking change_.
- **Many performance fixes and code size optimizations. Up to 70% performance boost for many moving nodes.**
- `layer.hitGraphEnabled()` is deprecated. Just use `layer.listening(false)` instead

Basically the release doesn't have any breaking changes. You may only have issues if you are using something from `Konva.DD` object (which is private and never documented). Otherwise you should be fine. `Konva` has major upgrade about touch events system and drag&drop flow. The API is exactly the same. But the internal refactoring is huge so I decided to make a major version. Please upgrade carefully. Report about any issues you have.

## Breaking

Customs builds are temporary removed from npm package. You can not use `import Konva from 'konva/src/Core';`.

- `Konva.Util._getImage` is removed
- `Konv.Util._getRGBAString` is removed
- `Konv.Util._merge` is removed
- Removed polyfill for `requestAnimationFrame`.

- New method `stage.setPointersPositions(event)`. Usually you don't need to use it manually.
